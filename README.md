# BrosFight  - Shoot 'Em Up Arcade Game (2016)

## Project Description

Welcome to my first programming project created back in 2016. This is a stationary "shoot 'em up" video game designed to be played in two-player multiplayer mode. Please note that since this was my first project, the code contains many errors and can surely be optimized further.

## Features

- **Multiplayer**: The game supports two players, offering a competitive and fun experience.
- **Platform**: Designed to be played on an arcade machine powered by Arduino, a project I also undertook.
- **Programming Language**: The code was written in Processing, a flexible and accessible language.

## Gameplay

Players have various abilities at their disposal to enhance the gaming experience:

- **Single shot**: A basic attack to combat opponents.
- **Laser beam**: A powerful attack that recharges in 5 seconds.
- **Dash**: A fast movement ability with a recharge time of 2.5 seconds.

## Game Controls

For an optimal experience, use an AZERTY keyboard. Here are the controls to play:

### General

- Simulate inserting a coin into the arcade machine: `Key P`
- Start the game: `Key O`

### Player 1

- Movement: `Arrow keys`
- Normal shot: `Key M`
- Laser beam / Dash: `Key L`

### Player 2

- Movement: `ZQSD`

## Conclusion

Thank you for checking out my first programming project. Feel free to explore the code and enjoy the game!
